# Brain-Tumour-Segmentation-Msc-Thesis-
Deep Learning for segmentation of multi-model Magnetic Resonance Images from brain tumour. Project for Msc Thesis at Leeds University.


Designed for the BRATS 2018 Training Dataset. To use:

1) Download and unzip the BRATS 2018 Dataset
2) From the Preprocessing folder, run the Unzip pogram
3) From the Preprocessing folder, run the Data Normalisation program
4) Code from the Model Executables folder can be used, includes the code allowing for Loading, Training, Saving of models. Also includes the code to obtain the final Segmentation Results as "ID".nii.gz files.
5) Code for Model Ensembling using Segmentations is available in the Postprocessing folder.
